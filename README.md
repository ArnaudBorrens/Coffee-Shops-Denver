# Coffe-Shops-Denver

In this project we are helping a coffee shop owner determine where to setup their new coffee shop in Denver. 
To do this we'll use **demographic data** as well as **geographic data** to first clean the data and then visualize it using a combination of **GeoDataFrame** and **Matplotlib**. 

This project was create in the context of the Datacamp competition 'Where to open a new coffee shop?'
