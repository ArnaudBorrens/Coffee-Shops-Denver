# Coffe-Shops-Denver

In this project, we are helping a coffee shop owner determine where to set up their new coffee shop in Denver. 
To do this we'll use **demographic data** as well as **geographic data** to first clean the data and then visualize it using a combination of **GeoDataFrame** and **Matplotlib**. 

This project was created in the context of the Datacamp competition 'Where to open a new coffee shop?'
